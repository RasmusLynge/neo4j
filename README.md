# Assignment 4: Neo4j Cluster Application

### cluster of minimum three Neo4j servers and two replicas  
Cluster was set up on our local Windows machines using [the guide from Martin](https://cphbusiness.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=551727ed-3f24-4c02-ba90-ad1d00f5b2a7)

### Software development methodology graph database  
The guide for this task does not seem to be working https://neo4j.com/graphgist/software-development-process-model-2

### Client application, which retrieves information from the database
In this project. But since the database guide does not work this part is not finished.
