# Assignment 4: Neo4j Cluster Application

### cluster of minimum three Neo4j servers and two replicas  
Cluster was set up on our local Windows machines using [this guide from Martin](https://cphbusiness.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=551727ed-3f24-4c02-ba90-ad1d00f5b2a7).

### Software development methodology graph database  
The guide for this task does not seem to be working https://neo4j.com/graphgist/software-development-process-model-2  
It might be a version error since the [gist](https://portal.graphgist.org/graph_gists/software-development-process-model-2/source) for the guide is for neo4j 3.0.0 and the current version is 4.0.0?  
  
We created a databse running v. 3 and used the cypther-shell from the terminal to run the two CREATE scripts from [the guides gist-source ](https://portal.graphgist.org/graph_gists/software-development-process-model-2/source). This seems to be working?  


### Client application, which retrieves information from the database
Look for the client application in this project.
